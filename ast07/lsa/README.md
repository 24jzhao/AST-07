## /lsa/  
This folder has anything and everything Lomb-Scargle-related. Rendered light curves are in the /staging/out.  

Idea.py and Idea.ipynb (unfinished) let you create folded light curves in bulk; see the files for more details.
a12lib.py is a nice little library I made that you can use to make the code a lot smaller.  It is a dependency of Idea.py.
lsa.py and lsa.ipynb is a PoC to filter out certain objects meeting certain conditions.
