## AST07 - Staging   
    
This folder contains experimental code that isn't stable enough to be fully merged (but stable enough to sorta work), so crashes and bugs are as common as bugfixes.  I mainly work on the .py files so they are always updated fist, but I usually convert & commit them together.  
Note that this folder is actively being worked on and is for testing purposes mostly, and I haven't optimized anything for non-BSD or -Linux systems.  You might find some neat stuff lying around the directory.  
The .py and .ipynb files do the exact same thing.
