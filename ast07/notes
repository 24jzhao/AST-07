TODO:
Examine D1 Xtreme Variable candidated via plotting measured RMS in ugriz bands as bold symbols against data points
o Sigma value 3 or 4 might be good (pos. using X2GOF + normcdf()?)

ZI not observed, scratch it out

Apply log(2) log(3) log(5) lines to star graph(?)
-Below Log(2) not cared about
-Log(2)~Log(3) is maginal
-Log(3)~Log(5) is intermediate [sic]
-Log(5)+ is Xtreme

3-digit code to identify UGR value w/ prop
UGR, 0,1,2,3 w/ number id



ME = 10E(~RMS_observed)


run (t,msgs,...)
and4 400,000
- Check w/ 1k first 

get updated csv from chris w/ vals

get array of objects of max P_multi compared to average of 20?


max(P_multi/np.mean(P_multi) -- compare max vs mean, make it greater than 20
