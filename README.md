## Status
**TODO**: screw around with histogram bins to get a decent result.
Current Editing Environment incase something goes awry:

* Jupyter Editor: [Vim w/ vim-jukit](https://github.com/luk400/vim-jukit)
* OS: FreeBSD 13.1-Stable (GENERIC)
* Shell: tcsh and the original sh (affects env. variables)


## Setup & Directory info
---
### Setup:
The [setup.sh](https://github.com/24jzhao/AST-07/blob/ethan/setup.sh) file should take care of everything for you.  If, for whatever reason it doesn't, follow these steps:

* Drag the ast07 folder into your home directory 
	* C:\Users\ in M$ Windows
	* /Users/ on MacOS (Accessible through ⌘+⇧+H in Finder)
* Drag AST-07 (repo folder) into ~/ast07
	* If AST-07 doesn't exist, then create it
