## Status
**TODO**: 
Add on-demand downloading of star files _as needed_ via HTTP to reduce storage consumption
Make this not cluttered


Current Editing Environment incase something goes awry:

* Jupyter Editor: [Vim w/ vim-jukit](https://github.com/luk400/vim-jukit)
* OS: FreeBSD 13.1-Stable (GENERIC)
* Shell: tcsh and the original sh (affects env. variables)


## Setup & Directory info

### Setup:
*Setup isn't needed anymore!* (You should still run it to get best results)

The [setup.sh](https://github.com/24jzhao/AST-07/blob/ethan/setup.sh) file should take care of everything for you.
